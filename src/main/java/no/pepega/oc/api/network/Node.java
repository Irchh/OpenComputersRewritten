 * A single node in a {@link Network}.

 * Per default there are two kinds of nodes: tile entities and items.
 * <br>
 * Items will usually only have nodes when in containers, such as a computer or
 * disk drive. Otherwise you'll have to connect/disconnect them manually as
 * desired.
 * <br>
 * All other kinds of nodes you may come up with will also have to be
 * handled manually.
 * <br>
 * Items have to be handled by a corresponding {@link DriverItem}.
 * Existing blocks may be interfaced with the adapter block if a
 * {@link DriverBlock} exists that supports the block.
 * <br>
 * <em>Important</em>: like the <tt>Network</tt> interface you must not create
 * your own implementations of this interface. Use the factory methods in the
 * network API to create new node instances and store them in your environment.
